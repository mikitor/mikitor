👋 Hi there! I'm a passionate Senior Software Engineer with 5+ years of experience building scalable, impactful solutions using Node.js, TypeScript, React, React Native, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and AWS.

🌍 Dedicated to crafting technology that drives social impact, particularly in healthcare and education.

🎓 Currently pursuing an MBA at Quantic, honing my data-driven decision-making, operational analysis, and strategic leadership skills to bridge the gap between tech and transformative change.

🚀 Core Expertise:

- Full-stack development with modern frameworks and tools
- Agile methodologies, TDD, and CI/CD practices
- Cloud architecture and scalable backend systems

📌 Always eager to collaborate on projects that make a difference! Let's connect and build something meaningful.

🌟 Note: Most of my professional projects were developed using GitLab, Azure DevOps, and Bitbucket, so my GitHub primarily showcases personal and open-source contributions. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to know more about my work!
